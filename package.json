  "description": "Jet Fuel is a URL shortened application that was our first project building a backend in module 4. Jet Fuel allows users to create folders to store long, ugly URLs as shortened URLs. The main goal of this application is to redirect a request at the shortened URL to their longer URL equivalent. Each shortened URL belongs to a unique folder which is capable of storing any number of URLs. Our secondary goal is to track URL usage and provide popularity statistics.",
